** Introduction
John Ridley Stroop published the groundbreaking, "Studies of interference in serial verbal ractions" in the Journal of Experimental Psychology in 1935 \cite{Stroop1935}. Ever since, psychology students worldwide learn about the "Stroop effect", where incongruent stimuli take longer to process than do congruent stimuli. Even though Stroop wasn't the first to publish this effect, his experiments were foundational; his original study is one of the most-cited papers in the history of experimental psychology \cite{MacLeod1991Stroop}.

In one part of Stroop's classic study, participants had to say the ink colour of the printed word rather than read the word. For instance, if the word 'RED' was printed in purple ink, they were to say, "purple" and not "red". Stroop noticed that subjects took significantly longer to complete this colour naming task than one where they just had to name the colour of coloured squares. This difference in response time, or processing speed, is what is known as the Stroop effect.

** Methods
There have been many variations on Stroop's experiment over the years. Since key presses are easier to time than a person reading aloud, we chose to go with a "manual" Stroop task where reaction time is measured by how long it takes a participant to press a certain key on a keyboard after being shown the stimuli on the computer screen. We used the psychopy library in python to program the experiment \cite{Peirce2019Psychopy} and followed the example shown in the demo Stroop task at psytoolkit.org \cite{PsytoolkitStroopDemo}. 

Python was the only tool we used in our project, we used it to code our experiment and as our computational tool

** Results

*** Descriptive statistics

We had our 5 group members complete src_python[:session *StroopData* :exports results :results raw]{int((data.shape[0]+1)/20)} trials, and in total we got src_python[:session *StroopData* :exports results :results raw]{(data.shape[0])} data points related to the stroop test.

Of those data points we had src_python[:session *StroopData* :exports results :results raw]{(data.shape[0]-congruent_wrong-incongruent_wrong)} valid data points and src_python[:session *StroopData* :exports results :results raw]{(congruent_wrong+incongruent_wrong)} invalid data points.
In our trials we defined Congruent trials as trials where the colour word and the font colour match. Incongruent trials are where the font colour is different than the word spelled out. Out of the src_python[:session *StroopData* :exports results :results raw]{(data.shape[0]-congruent_wrong-incongruent_wrong)} valid data points we had src_python[:session *StroopData* :exports results :results raw]{(congruent_x.shape[0])} valid congruent trials and src_python[:session *StroopData* :exports results :results raw]{(incongruent_x.shape[0])} valid incongruent trials.

We calculated the Stroop effect as the average response time for correct, incongruent trials minus correct, congruent trials. That stroop value for us was src_python[:session *StroopData* :exports results :results raw]{int(((np.average(incongruent)-np.average(congruent))*1000))}ms. That number resulted from the subtraction of src_python[:session *StroopData* :exports results :results raw]{int((np.average(incongruent))*1000)}ms, the average time for of an incongruent trial, with src_python[:session *StroopData* :exports results :results raw]{int((np.average(congruent))*1000)}ms, the average time of a congruent trial.

Next we need to show that this value has some significance, and to do this we will use a t-test and compare the mean of the congruent trials against the mean of the incongruent trials.

***  Collect data into a dataframe:

In this section we do the following 2 things.
First, we import all the relavent libraries that we need for any code to run.
Second, we itterate through all the csv files and merge them into one big pandas
data frame called  data.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session *StroopData* :exports both :results output
#graphics :file "StroopPlot.png"
import pandas as pd
import os
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

files = os.listdir()

# Identify all csv files in the directory
csv_files = []
for file in files:
    if file[-4:] == ".csv":
        csv_files.append(file)
data = pd.DataFrame()
for file in csv_files:
    data = data.append(pd.read_csv(file))

pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)

*** Scatter Plot with Line of Best fit

The code below shows us creating a scatter plot.
The scatter plot below shows the relationship between occurence in the test and reaction time.
The x-axis represents the occurence within the test, when you run our Stroop test you have to 
react to 20 congruent or incongruent tests, each test is mapped to an occurence in the stroop test 
ranging from 1 to 20 and that number coordinates to the value in the x-axis. The y-axis cooresponds to 
the response time in miliseconds. Only correct responses were plotted. We noticed that the response time was not very coorilated with the occurence in the stroop test, the only differentiator was the congruency, with congruent stroop tests having a noticibly smaller response time than incongruent stroop tests. Below we have the code we used to generate the plot and on the next page we have the plot itself which clearly differentiates between the congruent and incongruent responses and also shows a line of best fit for each congruency type.

congruent_x = np.array([])

        if i[1]['Word'] == i[1]['Ink']:
            congruent_x = np.append(congruent_x, i[0]+1)
            congruent_y = np.append(congruent_y, i[1]['Response Time']*1000)
        else:

            incongruent_y = np.append(incongruent_y, i[1]['Response Time']*1000)

*** Correct Stroop Responses and Calculated Average Response Time

In this section we calculate the average response time of the responses for both congruent and incongruent cases. We only consider cases where we correctly clicked the right key. Below is the code we used to calculate the average response time and below that we have the plot that illustrates the difference in the average response time.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session *StroopData* :exports both :results value file 
#output graphics :file "StroopPlotAverage.jpg"
# Average Congruent vs Incongruent Time
congruent = np.array([])
incongruent = np.array([])
for i in data.iterrows():
    if i[1]['Correct']:
        if i[1]['Word'] == i[1]['Ink']:
            congruent = np.append(congruent, i[1]['Response Time'])
        else:
            incongruent = np.append(incongruent, i[1]['Response Time'])

width = 0.35
state = ('Congruent', 'Incongruent')
state_average = (np.average(congruent)*1000, np.average(incongruent)*1000)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
rects = ax.bar(np.arange(2)+width, state_average, width, color='g')
ax.set_ylabel('Response Time (ms)')
ax.set_title('Response Time based on Congruency')
ax.set_xticks(np.arange(2)+width)
ax.set_xticklabels(('Congruent', 'Incongruent'))

*** Total Incorrect Stroop Responses Analysis

The final graph we include here is the incorrect responses made. We found out that our group had a significantly higher chance of making a mistake on on incongruent cases versus congruent cases. For our group there were 8 times as many incorrect keystrokes made for incongruent cases in comparison to congruent cases.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session *StroopData* :exports both :results value file
#output graphics :file "StroopPlotIncorrect.jpg"
congruent_wrong = 0
incongruent_wrong = 0
for i in data.iterrows():
    if not i[1]['Correct']:
        if i[1]['Word'] == i[1]['Ink']:
            congruent_wrong+=1
        else:
            incongruent_wrong+=1

width = 0.35
state = ('Congruent', 'Incongruent')
wrong_count  = (congruent_wrong, incongruent_wrong)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
rects = ax.bar(np.arange(2)+width, wrong_count, width, color='r')
ax.set_ylabel('Total Incorrect Responses')
ax.set_title('Incorrect Responses Based on Congruency')
ax.set_xticks(np.arange(2)+width)
ax.set_xticklabels(('Congruent', 'Incongruent'))

** Discussion and Conclusions
 
Our experiment takes less than two minutes to complete. It requires pressing the appropriate keyboard key rather than naming the colour aloud as Stroop did originally \cite{Stroop1935}. In our test, there are only 20 trials and 5 of participants. For a more reliable measure of the Stroop effect you would want to have considerably more participants along with more trials.
