In this experiment,we are studying how the response time two groups of participants spent in the face of congruent stimulus and incongruent stimulus.
Besides we are also interested in the correct rate of answering  between the two groups.

Steps:
1.Firstly weâ€™ve screened out the wrong or extra individual cases from participants in order to keep the same numbers in two group(100 per group)check
the Independent-Sample T-Test.On the basis of relevant documents,we make the Null hypothesis and the Alternate hypothesis as following:
H0:There is no difference between the mean response time for congruent stimulus group compare to incongruent  stimulus group.
Ha:There is a difference between the mean response time for congruent stimulus group compare to incongruent stimulus group.
2.We are supposed to compare the correct rate between the two groups without deleting any individual cases.

Results:
Table 1 Descriptive Statistics
   Different groups  	 N	    Mean of response time
  Congruent stimulus	100	        0.84645023
  Incongruent stimulus	100	        0.96180698

Table 2 Independent Samples Test
	             df	    t	  Sig. (2-tailed)	 Std.Error Difference
  Response time	 198   -3.202	    0.002	           0.036024650

Table 3 Correct rate in different groups
                 Congruent stimulus	Incongruent stimulus
  Correct ones	         166	             100
      Total 	         178	             101
  Correct rate	         0.93	             0.99

Analysis summary
From the Table 2,t(198)=3.2,P=.002<.05,so we are safe to reject the Null hypothesis and get the conclusion that there is a significant difference between
the mean response time for 	congruent stimulus group compare to incongruent stimulus group.Besides, Table 1 shows that the Incongruent stimulus group keeps
the larger mean of 0.962 than the other one of 0.846.In other words,people do spend more time when meeting the condition of Incongruent stimulus.

Table 3 illustrated that the correct rate of congruent group is lower than the value of incongruent group.
